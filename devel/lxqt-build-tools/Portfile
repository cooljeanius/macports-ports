description         Various packaging tools and scripts for LXQt \
                    applications

long_description    This repository is providing several tools needed \
                    to build LXQt itself as well as other components \
                    maintained by the LXQt project. These tools used \
                    to be spread over the repositories of various \
                    other components and were summarized to ease \
                    dependency management. So far many components, in \
                    particular liblxqt, were representing a build \
                    dependency without being needed themselves but \
                    only because their repository was providing a \
                    subset of the tools which are now summarized here. \
                    So the use of this repository will reduce \
                    superfluous and bloated dependencies.
